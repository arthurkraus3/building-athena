After learning to build Athena in Shell 1 [[Building Athena]]

I built ROOT with my changes in Shell 2, 

going back to Shell 1, I have my modified athena selected using
```
source ../build/x86_64-cnetos7-gcc11-opt/setup.sh
```

Again, in shell 1, running each of the following export commands I have a version of my own ROOT and my own Athena

next is to see if I can run the derivation job [[Phase 5 - Running a derivation job on modified Athena]]

5:04 PM: It's running

5:08PM
![[Pasted image 20230722170818.png]]

and it crashed

this time, running  
```
lsetup "asetup Athena,main,latest"
```

and rerunning the derivation job 

5:15PM showing much more progress
